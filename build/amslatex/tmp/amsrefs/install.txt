install.txt for amsrefs 2.0 [2004-06-30]

Preliminary note: The normal destination directory for amsrefs.sty in a
standard TDS structure would be texmf/tex/latex/amscls (see step 3
below). In the future, the amsrefs package will be integrated more
thoroughly into the amscls distribution, but the current release has to
be provided in the form of a separate distribution for those who already
have the amscls distrib but not amsrefs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first step is to identify the primary location for LaTeX input files
on your system. Typical examples are

  /usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex...   (Unix)

  C:\SWP30\TCITeX\TeX\LaTeX...          (Windows)

We define "ROOT" to mean everything preceding the "/tex/latex" part. In
the second example, this would be "C:\SWP30\TCITeX". ROOT will normally
end in "texmf"; if it doesn't you may need to consult the documentation
for your TeX system to find out what to use. In the following
instructions, wherever you see ROOT substitute the actual directory or
folder name that is used on your system.

If this terminology doesn't make sense to you, seek assistance from
a friend or colleague, or from the company that you bought your TeX
system from, or contact us at

  401-455-4080

If you have multiple texmf trees (as discussed, for example, in the
teTeX documentation), you may want to install amsrefs using the
TEXMFLOCAL tree as the value of ROOT. In due course when you upgrade to
a newer TeX system, we expect that you will find amsrefs already
incorporated into the TEXMFMAIN tree as part of the tex/latex/amscls
area, at which point you will no longer need the copy in your TEXMFLOCAL
tree.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Download the following archive file:

   ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/amsrefs.zip

2. Extract files using the texmf root directory as the destination. Some
typical examples:

WinZip: Click on "Extract" and then in the "Extract to" box, enter
        c:\sw\texmf (or whatever ROOT is on your system)

unzip:  unzip amsrefs.zip -d ROOT

3. Please note that although the source files for amsrefs unpack into
the ROOT/source/latex/amsrefs area at the present time [2001-12-28], the
other files unpack into .../latex/amscls because that is the natural
location for them.

To check the end result, you should find that you now have amsrefs.sty
in the following location (substituting \ or : for / if appropriate):

  ROOT/tex/latex/amscls/amsrefs.sty

If you have a teTeX system you may need to rerun mktexlsr [known in
earlier versions of teTeX as "texhash"].

For a MikTeX system the command would be "initexmf -u", or look for
"Refresh the Filename Database" in the MikTeX menus (this may be
somewhat version-dependent).
